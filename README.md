# MakeuPedia

Makeupedia is an app for fun.
-----------------------------
It allows any user to find text that exists on a Wikipedia page and replace that text on their own. For example, a user can rewrite history by specifying that Steven Hawking was president of the United States in 1789. And why not? Home boy is amazing.
